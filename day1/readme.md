# ğŸš€ Day 1 of 25 â€“ Angular Learning Challenge

Welcome to **Day 1** of my 25-Day Angular Mastery Challenge!  
Today marks the start of an exciting journey into building modern, scalable front-end applications using **Angular**.

---

## âœ… What I Learned Today

### ğŸ”¹ Introduction to Angular
- Angular is a **TypeScript-based framework** developed by Google.
- It's designed for building **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**.
- Angular follows a component-based architecture and supports reactive programming with RxJS.

### ğŸ”¹ Why Angular?
- Built-in features like routing, forms, HTTP, and state management.
- Backed by Google â€” enterprise-ready.
- CLI-powered â€” speeds up development with powerful tooling.
- Ideal for large, maintainable, scalable applications.

### ğŸ”¹ Angular vs React vs Vue (Quick Comparison)
| Feature         | Angular          | React             | Vue               |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Type            | Framework        | Library           | Framework         |
| Language        | TypeScript       | JavaScript (JSX)  | JavaScript        |
| Architecture    | MVC/MVVM         | View (component)  | MVVM              |
| CLI             | Powerful         | Create React App  | Vue CLI           |
| Learning Curve  | Moderate to Hard | Easy to Moderate  | Easy              |
